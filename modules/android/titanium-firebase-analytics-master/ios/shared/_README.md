# README

The frameworks in this directory are placed here intentionally, because they should not be packaged with the module
to avoid duplicate framework references. They are delivered by the `titanium-firebase-core` module instead to retain
a clean dependency-separation.

## Questions
For questions, reach out on TiSlack (@hans), thx!
